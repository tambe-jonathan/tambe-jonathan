### ⭐ Professional Narrative: Defining Enterprise-Grade Infrastructure

👋 Welcome. My expertise is focused on engineering highly-available, secure, and cost-optimized infrastructure across **Azure** and **AWS**. With a strong foundation in **SRE principles** and a **GitOps-first mindset**, I drive developer velocity while maintaining enterprise governance and 99.99% uptime commitments.

| 🎯 **Senior Focus** | 💡 **Key Achievement** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Cloud Cost Optimization** | Achieved a sustained **20–30% reduction** in cloud operational costs through rightsizing, consumption modeling, and proactive governance (Azure Policies & Blueprints). |
| **CI/CD Velocity & Reliability** | Architected Jenkins/ArgoCD pipelines and GitOps workflows, increasing deployment frequency by **20%** and reducing production defects by **80%**. |
| **Architectural Governance** | Established IaC standards using **Terraform** and **Azure Bicep**, ensuring all provisioning is immutable, auditable, and compliant from day one. |

## 🛠️ &nbsp; The Enterprise Technical Stack

A quick snapshot of the tools I deploy at scale, categorized by operational discipline.

| 🟢 **Cloud & Compute** | 🟠 **IaC & Automation** | 🟣 **CI/CD & GitOps** | 🛡️ **SecDevOps & Governance** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AWS** (EKS, RDS, Lambda) | **Terraform** (Advanced) | **Argo CD** & **Flux CD** | **Azure Policies/Blueprints** |
| **Azure** (AKS, App Services) | **Azure Bicep** (Native) | **Jenkins** (Declarative) | **Key Vault** / Secrets Manager |
| **Kubernetes (AKS/EKS)** | **Ansible** (Config Mgmt) | **GitHub Actions** | **Trivy** (Vulnerability Scan) |
| **Docker & Helm** | **Python** / **Bash** / **PowerShell** | **SonarQube** (Quality Gates) | **OPA** (Policy as Code) |

### 🏛️ Architectural & Leadership Focus

As a Senior/SRE, my responsibilities extend beyond the pipeline. I focus on systemic improvements and driving cross-team best practices.

* **SRE & Observability:** Implemented a full Observability stack (**Prometheus, Grafana, Alert Manager**) to define and enforce actionable **SLOs** and **SLIs**, shifting the team from reactive firefighting to proactive reliability engineering.
* **Microservices Optimization:** Led the migration and optimization of microservice architectures onto Kubernetes (AKS/EKS), leveraging **Istio** (Service Mesh) for enhanced traffic management, security, and resiliency.
* **DevSecOps Strategy:** Embedded **security as code** into the SDLC, integrating tools like **Trivy** and leveraging cloud-native controls (**Azure Defender for Cloud**) to meet stringent compliance requirements.
* **Mentorship & Standards:** Drove documentation (Confluence) and cross-functional training to standardize GitOps workflows, ensuring consistent quality and enabling self-service infrastructure consumption by Development teams.
